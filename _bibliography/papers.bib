	abstract = {This paper discusses the development of an algorithm to extend "Natural Steganography" (NS) to JPEG images, this method could allow an insertion of a large size message with high empirical security. 
This schema uses the principle of cover source switching: starting from a cover image captured at $ISO_1$ the steganographic signal is generated to imitate an image captured at $ISO_2 > ISO_1$. 
At the sensor level, this change in sensitivity can be modelled by adding an independent photonic noise according to a Normal distribution. 
The problem of this method lies here in the modeling of this signal in the DCT domain. Starting from a RAW image, the processing steps considered are demosaicking (bi-linear), luminance averaging and quantification related to JPEG compression. They are modeled using a covariance matrix. 
The simplicity of this development scheme justifies the interest of this scheme which offers superior embedding rates compared to the state of the art ($>$1 bit per non-zero coefficient) while preserving high practical security ($PE \simeq 40\%$).},

@article{taburet2020natural,
	abstract = {In order to achieve high practical security, Natural Steganography (NS) uses cover images captured at ISO sensitivity $ISO1$ and generates stego images mimicking ISO sensitivity
$ISO_2 > ISO_1$. This is achieved by adding a stego signal to the cover that mimics the sensor photonic noise. 
This paper proposes an embedding mechanism to perform NS in the JPEG
domain after linear developments by explicitly computing the correlations between DCT coefficients before quantization. In order to compute the covariance matrix of the photonic noise
in the DCT domain, we first develop the matrix representation of demosaicking, luminance averaging, pixel section, and 2D-DCT. 

A detailed analysis of the resulting covariance matrix is done in order to explain the origins of the correlations between the coefficients of $3 \times 3$ DCT blocks. An embedding scheme is then presented that takes into account all the correlations.
It employs 4 sub-lattices and 64 lattices per sub-lattices. The modification probabilities of each DCT coefficient are then derived by computing conditional probabilities computed
from a multivariate Gaussian distribution using the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. This derivation is also used to compute the embedding capacity of each image. Using a
specific database called E1Base, we show that in the JPEG domain NS (J-Cov-NS) enables to achieve high capacity (more than 2 bits per non-zero AC DCT) and with high practical security
($P_E \simeq 40\%$ using DCTR and $P_E \simeq 32\%$ using SRNet) from $QF 75$ to $QF 100$).},

@inproceedings{taburet2019natural,
	abstract = {Using Natural Steganography (NS), a cover raw image acquired at sensitivity ISO1 is transformed into a stego image whose statistical distribution is similar to a cover image
acquired at sensitivity $ISO_2 > ISO_1$. This paper proposes such an embedding scheme for color sensors in the JPEG domain, extending thus the prior art proposed for the pixel domain and the JPEG domain for monochrome sensors.
We first show that color sensors generate strong intra-block and inter-block dependencies between DCT coefficients and that theses dependencies are due to the demosaicking step
in the development process. 
Capturing theses dependencies using an empirical covariance matrix, we propose a pseudoembedding algorithm on greyscale JPEG images which uses up to four sub-lattices and 64 lattices to embed information while preserving the estimated correlations among DCT coefficients. We then compute an approximation of the average embedding rate w.r.t. the JPEG quality factor and evaluate the empirical security of the proposed scheme for
linear and non-linear demosaicking schemes. Our experiments show that we can achieve high capacity (around 2 bit per nzAC) with a high empirical security ($P_E \simeq 30\%$ using DCTR at $QF 95$).},

@inproceedings{taburet2018empirical,
	abstract = {This paper tackles the problem of JPEG steganography and steganalysis for color images, a
problem that has rarely been studied so far and which deserves more attention. 
After focusing on the 4:4:4 sampling strategy, we propose to modify for each channel the embedding rate of J-UNIWARD and UERD steganographic schemes in order to arbitrary spread the payload between the luminance and the chrominance components while keeping a constant message size for the different strategies. 
We also compare our spreading payload strategy w.r.t. two strategies: (i) the concatenation of the cost map (CONC) or (ii) equal embedding rates (EER) among channels. We then select good candidates within the feature sets designed either for JPEG or color steganography. 

Our conclusions are threefold: (i) the GFR or DCTR features sets, concatenated on the three channels offer better performance than ColorSRMQ1 for JPEG Quality Factor (QF) of 75 and 95 but ColorSRMQ1 is more sensitive for QF=100, (ii) the CONC or EER strategies are suboptimal, and (iii) depending of the quality factors and the embedding schemes, the empirical security is maximized when between 33% (QF=100, UERD) and 95% (QF=75, J-UNIWARD) of the payload is allocated to the luminance channel.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/3369412.3395074,
	abstract = {This paper proposes to use the statistical analysis of the correlation between DCT coefficients to design a new synchronization strategy that can be used for cost-based steganographic schemes in the JPEG domain. 
First, an analysis is performed on the covariance matrix of DCT coefficients of neighboring blocks after a development pipeline similar to the one used to generate BossBase, and applied on a photonic noise. 
This analysis exhibits (i) a decomposition into 8 disjoint sets of uncorrelated coefficients (4 sets per block used by 2 disjoint lattices) and (ii) the fact that each DCT coefficient is correlated with 38 other coefficients belonging either to the same block or to connected blocks. 
Using the uncorrelated groups, an embedding scheme can be designed using only 8 disjoint lattices. 

The proposed embedding scheme relies on the following ingredients. 
Firstly, we convert the empirical costs associated to one each coefficient into a Gaussian distribution whose variance is directly computed from the embedding costs. 
Secondly we derive conditional Gaussian distributions from a multivariate distribution considering only the correlated coefficients which have been already modified by the embedding scheme. 
This covariance matrix takes into account both the correlations exhibited by the analysis of the covariance matrix and the variance derived from the costs. 
This synchronization scheme enables to obtain a gain of $P_E$ of at least $7%$ at $QF95$ for an embedding rate close to 0.3 bnzac coefficient using DCTR feature sets for both UERD and JUniward.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/3335203.3335715,
	abstract = {This short paper is an extension of a family of embedding schemes called Natural Steganography, which embeds a message by mimicking heteroscedastic sensor noise in the JPEG domain. Under the assumption that the development from RAW uses linear de- mosaicking, we derive a closed-form for the covariance matrix of DCT coefficients from $3 \times 3$ JPEG blocks. This computation relies on a matrix formulation of all steps involved in the development pipeline, which includes demosaicking, conversion to luminance, DCT transform, and reordering. This matrix is then used for pseudo-embedding in the JPEG domain on four lattices of $8 \times 8$ DCT blocks. The results obtained with the computed covariance matrix are contrasted with the results previously obtained with the covariance matrix estimated using Monte Carlo sampling and scaling. The empirical security using DCTR features at JPEG quality 100 increased from $P_E = 14\%$ using covariance estimation and scaling to $P_E = 43\%$ using the newly derived analytic form.},

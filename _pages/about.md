I am a freshly graduated doctor in Steganography from the Ecole Centrale de Lille (France), whose topic was focusing on the exploitation of camera sensor noise to embedded hidden informations into JPEG images. 
Embedding a sensitive message into innocuous content without the presence of the message being obvious is the whole idea of steganography.

I also hold a MSc in Digital Signal and Image Processing from the Cranfield University (UK) and a general Engineering Diploma from ESTIA (France).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
